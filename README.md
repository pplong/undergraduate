Proposed a new definition (three degree of variations for FQ-compatible, trade-off, compromise) based on “Towards
Robust Service Compositions in the Context of Functionally Diverse Services” to improve the value of QoS and users’
satisfaction
Optimized the traversal algorithm using Skyline depending on new definition, resulting in 1519 times smaller in
searching space and 32 times faster in exploring time
Developed variation algorithm, and reduced the searching area & promoted searching speed 3 times better than op-
timized traversal algorithm
Operated 828 projects, and achieved 5.08% improvement of QoS for 453 FQcompatible projects, 8% for 485 FQtrade-
off projects and 11% for 566 FQcompromise projects
